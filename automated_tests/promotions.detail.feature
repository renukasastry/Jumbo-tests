Feature: promotions.detail.feature
As a user I want to be able to see the details of a promotion
so I can see on which products the promotion applies


#  @smoke_test
#  Scenario: I want to check an individual PROMOTION is there and clickable
#    Given I am a logged in B2C user
#    When I tap the promotions tab
#    And I tap the firstPromotion view
## Previous step always fails because there are no promotions available on SIT
#    Then the skuPlus button is displayed
