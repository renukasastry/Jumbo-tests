* User needs a minimal of 4 completed orders with the last one placed within the last 30 days to get a "askSurvey": true from UX-API
* After app receives "askSurvey": true users will be asked the how they feel after placing another order
* Due to Ice not being able to create completed orders, some tests can not be executed without the help of Jumbo
* A "True" response can be mocked (with charles) to trigger the survey screen
* For Android, the new view will be displayed at the end of the checkout flow in front of the smiley screen.
In iOS, it will be displayed in front of the shopping list
