## FEATURE
Autocomplete

***

## Test Basis
Autocomplete: <https://icemobile.atlassian.net/browse/JUMBOAPP-3694>

***

## Test Ideas

User gets frequently used suggestion first

- Select the same suggestion a few times and see it move up in the list of suggestions
- select another suggestion a bunch of times and see it pass the first suggestion 
 
***

Autocomplete can get refreshed by sending the app a new = header
<br>Steps

- Catch the call to get the autocomplete
- replace the timestamp to something in the near future 
- wait till it expires
- try if the call is triggered again

***

Order of autosuggest is not changed after update

- frequently used suggestions are still displayed first after suggestions are updated

***

Order of autosuggest is not changed after update when frequently used suggestion is no longer available

- Except for the removed suggestion (which does not show) the frequently used suggestions are still displayed first after suggestions are updated

***



## Bugs

## Notes
User can see the autocomplete in searchfields in the following places:

* shopping list
* search products
* search recipes
* search products from add ingredients
***

While Android only does it once, iOS makes the autocomplete call twice. The reason for this needs to be investigated.
