## Bugs 

- N/A

## Test Notes

- Chain testing for Push Notification is out of scope and responsibility lies with Jumbo.
- Important edge case: 
	- On Android, if you kill the app during the onboarding process at the push notification screen, you will not see the push notification pop up when you re-open the app. You will be back in the onboarding flow (the next step after the push notification). Only after you go through the onboarding flow and you have gone to another module (e.g. Promotions) and then back to My Jumbo will you see the push notification pop up.
