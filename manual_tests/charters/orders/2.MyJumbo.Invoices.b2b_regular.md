## Test Ideas
### My Jumbo screen test ideas

* Check visibility of invoices <br>
*- Invoices only visible in My Jumbo for logged in B2B regular users*

* Check pressed state

***

### Invoices overview test ideas

* Check if all types of invoices can be displayed <br>
*- Unpayed <br>*
*- Payed in full <br>*
*- Payed and processed + Payed not processed <br>*

* Check the sorting of all the invoice types 

* Check different amounts of invoices from different types (0, 5, 10, 20) (pagination)

* Open a PDF with PDF viewer (Android)

* Try to open a corrupted PDF 

* Try to open the PDF in a browser (Android) <BR>

***

### Other test ideas

* **Check the user validation when requesting a PDF** (tokens) <br> 
*- There is a huge impact if a user were to be able to request a PDF belonging to another user. This should be thorougly tested.*

* Don't keep activities and check the flow

* Step out of the flow on every step
