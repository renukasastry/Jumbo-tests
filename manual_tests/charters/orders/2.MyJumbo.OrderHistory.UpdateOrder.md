* Check the early cut off cell in all 3 states (applied, not applied, not applicable)
* For an order where early cut off does not apply change the pup so early cut off applies and vice versa
* For an order with early cut off applied, remove the early cut off, and vice versa 
* Check the early cut off page in both states (preselected optieon, price, discount, cut off time, etc.) 
* For an order with early cut off applied, change the slot or store to something else. Try multiple options. (Early cut off is removed)
