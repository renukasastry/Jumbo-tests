User gets the option to select an earlier cut off time and receive an discount

***
## Test Basis
* [JUMBOAPP-4351](https://icemobile.atlassian.net/browse/JUMBOAPP-4351) - Project Cut-off - Show 'Select Cut Off Time' option after thank you screen
* [Confluence](https://icemobile.atlassian.net/wiki/display/JUM/Early+cutoff+time+discount) - information on early cut off

***

## Test Ideas
* Check if the screen is displayed after the 'Thank you page' when the requirements are met (and not at all if they are not).
* Check all the configurable screen elements with different configuration 
* Check if the discount is applied when opted for <br>
	- No call when the option is not used
* Check if user can switch back and forth between the options without this effecting his order
* Check if the screen does not impact the screens that could follow after (Use different combinations of Push permission, Favorite helper, Rate the app)
* Check the errors
* Check that the next screen is not displayed untill the update order is successfull
