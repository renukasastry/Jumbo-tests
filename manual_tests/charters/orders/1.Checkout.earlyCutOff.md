## Test Basis
* [JUMBOAPP-4351](https://icemobile.atlassian.net/browse/JUMBOAPP-4351) - Project Cut-off - Show 'Select Cut Off Time' option after thank you screen
* [Confluence](https://icemobile.atlassian.net/wiki/display/JUM/Early+cutoff+time+discount) - information on early cut off

***

## Test Ideas
* Check if the screen is displayed after the 'Thank you page' when the requirements are met
* Check if the screen is not displayed if the requirements are not met
* Check all the configurable elements with different values
* Check if the discount is applied when opted for <br>
	- No call when the option is not used
* Check if user can switch back and forth between the options without this effecting his order
* Check if the screen does not impact the screens that could follow after (Use different combinations of Push permission, Favorite helper, Rate the app)
* Check the errors <br> 
	- All errors have a retry except cut off time passed error, that has an ok and then goes to the next screen) 
* Check that the next screen is not displayed untill the update order is successfull
* Check tapping the back button (Android only)
