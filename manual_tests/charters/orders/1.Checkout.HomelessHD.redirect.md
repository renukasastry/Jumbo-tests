# Redirect B2C homeless users to the new Edit Profile flow


## Test Basis


[JUMBOAPP-3659](https://icemobile.atlassian.net/browse/JUMBOAPP-3659 )

***
## Test Setup
<br/>
**Test data:** (March 7th) We currently have some homeless users ranging from homelessnick60@ice.com until homelessnick101@ice.com
<br/><br/>
If you cannot work with the existing test data, check with the awesome UX-API(ML) people to create a few homeless user accounts (users that have no address)

***
## Test Ideas

###Flow 1: Place Order


Login with homeless user -->Create Order (add Products to SL + Checkout) --> select HD.(the flow informs the user that he has no address).


* User is taken to the Personal section of the B2C Edit Profile flow. (Update and place the order to complete this test)
***
	

###Flow 2: Update Order 


Login with other homeless user -->Create Order (add Products to SL + Checkout) --> select PUP --> Place Order--> Go to My Jumbo -->Order History --> Select recently placed order--> Modify it and select HD (the flow informs the user that he has no address).

* User is taken to the Personal section of the B2C Edit Profile flow. (Update and place the order to complete this test)
***


###Flow 3: Place Order (logistics flow)


Login with other homeless user -->Create Order (do not add Products to SL, just Checkout)--> select HD.(the flow informs the user that he has no address).


* User is taken to the Personal section of the B2C Edit Profile flow. (Update and place the order to complete this test)
