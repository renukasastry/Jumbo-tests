## Test Ideas
The following ideas are applicable when user:

- Books a time slot at a pick up point 
- Books a time slot for home delivery
- Edits an open order and select a new time slot

### Reserve a slot
- An horizontal row with the next 21 days is displayed
- Every block of day should display the cheapest time slot  
- When you select a block, all available and unavailable times are displayed with their prices 
- If a slot is unavailable it should show "Bezet" and cannot be selected 
- The cheapest time slot is no more shown as "Gratis", â‚¬0,00 is displayed instead 
- When the screen is presented to the user, the first day with an available time slot is displayed
- Disclaimer should be displayed in the end of the screen

### Alternative flows
- In case there is no slots available for a particular store, the zero result screen should be displayed
- If all slots are occupied for a date, "Bezet" should be displayed in that date block
- Multi store selection 
	- as a B2C user, change the delivery address to Hoofdstraat 70 - 3901AT - VEENENDAAL and check if the multi store selector is displayed after you select a date and time slot
	- as a B2B sub user, change the delivery address to Hoofdstraat 70 - 3901AT - VEENENDAAL and check if the multi store selector is NOT displayed after you select a date and time slot
