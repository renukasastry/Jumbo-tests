## Test Basis
<https://icemobile.atlassian.net/browse/JUMBOAPP-3593>

***

## Test Ideas
 

**General approach:**

- Place Open (do again x2, 1 in the future, 1 to the closest slot) 
- Cancel 1 open order 
- Check In process (These are automatically put to this state from open orders once their slot expires)
- Mock Ready for Delivery / Ready for pickup (or wait until they are converted) See JSON for mocking Orders in test data
- Give 1 Open Order to Ralf to put to COMPLETED (1 from each account)

## Bugs
Completed Orders made Android crash. (Fixed)
Missing payment methods on Android and iOS (Fixed)

***
## Notes
The actual ESB system for B2B users (Regular and Sub) is not in place yet so we cannot put orders to COMPLETED.
We will only check the completed status for B2C at this point and then we can do the B2B Completed status test in Integration.
