## Notes

Postal code samples:

* Germany -> 10115 - 14199: Berlin
* Belgium -> 1000â€“1299: Brussels Capital Region

**VALIDATION RULES**

<br> - Postal code: 

* (Dutch addresses) 4 numbers + 2 letters.
* (German addresses) 5 numbers
* (Belgium addresses) 4 numbers

<br> - If the user enters a space in between the numbers and letters (common behaviour), the space is filtered out as we will only send 6 characters to UX-API

<br> - House number:

* Only numbers
* Maximum of 6 characters

<br> - Addition:

* Maximum of 25 characters
* All characters are allowed (even special characters)
