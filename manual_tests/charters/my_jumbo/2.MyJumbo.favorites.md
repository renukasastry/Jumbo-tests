#Favorites
List of favorites accessible on my Jumbo and flagging products and recipes as favorite
***

## Test Basis

* [JUMBOAPP-4365](https://icemobile.atlassian.net/browse/JUMBOAPP-4365) - Favorites sorting <br>
 
***

## Test Ideas

* Check if favorites are only available for logged in users (don't forget the heart thingy on the pdp and rdp)
* Check if it's possible to favorite recipes (also check the list)
* Check if it's possible to favorite products of all types
* Check if it's possible to unfavorite products and recipes (also check the lists)
* Check if the favorites are still correct after logging out and logging in again (note the syncing issue might interfere)
* Check if favorites made on web are displayed in the app (both recipes and products)
* Check if the favorite product list is sorted in catagories (check all catageories)
* Check if category headers are hidden after all products within that category are no longer favorites 
* Check if the category headers dock in the top when scrolling (iOS only)
* Check if products favorited via the favorite helper are displayed in the list

## Bugs
* [Syncing - Javelin ticket](https://jira.javelingroup.com/browse/JUM-9299)
* [Syncing - Schuberg ticket](https://jira.schubergphilis.com/browse/JMB-5145)

***

## Observations
* Note that favorite syncing has been an issue forever and it's not working properly. Favorite calls fail more often than not. ([Javelin ticket](https://jira.javelingroup.com/browse/JUM-9299) and [Schuberg ticket](https://jira.schubergphilis.com/browse/JMB-5145)
