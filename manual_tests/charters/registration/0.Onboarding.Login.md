Home store selection

The ideas bellow should be checked on the *Home Store Selection/ Kies Je Winkel* screen

* On iOS 7+ and Android 6.0+ the request to use the location should only be triggered if the user taps the location arrow button. 
* On android devices bellow 6.0 the request to use location is placed when the app is installed, so if the user denies or removes it,  a message is shown bellow the search field informing the location is disabled followed by instructions of how to turn it on.
* User can search for stores ordered by proximity to an address or zip-code.
* All available stores should be shown, ordered by proximity and the distance to the stores should also be displayed in KM or meters in case it is smaller than 1km.
* If user doesn't allow the app to use his location then a message should be shown bellow the location field. 
* If the user taps the arrow to have his location used and the location could not be retrieved, a message is displayed (could be either in the start screen or the results one) informing him so. In this case he can proceed using the	search field. 
* If user starts to move and change his location, the list of results is not updated automatically, user needs to tap the location button again to refresh the list of stores.
* Check the kies je winkel flow on an Android device with don't keep activities ON. 
* Deny access to location when requested and check if the message about how to enabled it is displayed bellow the text field.
* Try to use the GPS location from a covered place, where the GPS position can not be retrieved and check if the alert message recommending to use the search field is displayed.
* Put the divide on flight mode, tap the location button and check if an error message of no connection is shown
* Check if going back one screen before kies je winkel works.
* Search for an address, put the app in background and check if the screen is displayed correctly when you're back
* Use your location to list stores, put the app in background, using android studio kill the activity, reopen the app and search again, the same list should be displayed if the location didn't change. 
* If the request to get the list of stores fail, an error message and the button to try again should be displayed.
