	- If the valid from and valid to dates are the same for promotional items items within this section, both dates should be presented in the sub-header;
	- If only the valid to dates are the same for all promotional items within this section, only this date should be presented in the sub-header
	- If only the valid from dates are the same for all promotional items within this section, only valid from dates should be presented in the sub-header
